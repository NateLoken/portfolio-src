                    <h4>Hello my Name is Nathaniel Loken.</h4>
                    <br />
                    I am a dedicated Software Engineer seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise in building innovative software solutions that make a global impact. I am passionate about working in dynamic environments that encourage learning, collaboration, and continuous growth.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During my internship with NASA, I gained hands-on experience in test-driven development, continuous integration, and Agile practices. I developed a comprehensive test suite, created CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, and built an endpoint for file validation and database 
                    integrationâ€”contributing to efficient project development and deployment.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Following that, as a Full-stack Engineer at the Mental Health Wellness Center, I developed an online Learning Management System to deliver life coaching content. Using Python, Django for the backend, and Vue.js for the frontend, I integrated payment functionality 
                    through Stripe to create a seamless user experience.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Currently, I am an Embedded Software Engineer at Raytheon, leading a team in the development and maintenance of embedded weapon software. I manage all aspects of the project lifecycle, from design and implementation to testing in various environments. 
                    My role has sharpened my leadership, technical problem-solving, and project management skills, particularly in the embedded systems domain.
